# Air Purifier IoT Project Repository

This repository contains the source code, circuit diagrams, and documentation for an IoT-based air purifier developed as part of a project for Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to design and build an air purifier system that can effectively remove airborne pollutants and improve indoor air quality. The air purifier utilizes IoT technology to provide real-time monitoring and control capabilities. It includes sensors for measuring air quality parameters, such as particulate matter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
